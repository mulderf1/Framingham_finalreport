## Having a high glucose concentration increse the risk of having diabetes - the Fringham study

```{r}
#| output: false  
library(gitcreds)
library(unibeCols)
library(usethis)
library(riskCommunicator)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(rstatix)
data("framingham")
library(here)
```

In this study we will evaluate the correlation between glucose values and the risk of diabetes. We will first look at descriptive statistics of glucose in the framingham population such as the mean, the median, the 1st and the 3rd quartile. After this we will make the histogram of the distribution. We will also calculate the 95% interval for the mena of the glucose value. Then we want to analyse, if diabetic have another glucose value thant non-diabetic. Is the ditribution of the glucose value normal ? Is it there is a strong evidence against the null hypothesis ?

## Descriptive statistics

In this section, descriptive statistics will be displayed to better understand the risk of glucose on diabetes.

```{r}
sum(framingham$GLUCOSE)
sum(is.na(framingham$GLUCOSE))
sum(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(!is.na(framingham$GLUCOSE))
mean_GLUC <- mean(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = TRUE)
sorted_GLU <- sort(framingham$GLUCOSE)
sum(is.na(sorted_GLU))
length(sorted_GLU)
mean_GLUC <- mean(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm =  TRUE)
middle_GLU <- (length(sorted_GLU) + 1) / 2
sorted_GLU[middle_GLU]
median_GLU <- median(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm =  TRUE) 
quart_GLU <- quantile(framingham$GLUCOSE, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
                      na.rm = TRUE)
sum((framingham$GLUCOSE - mean_GLUC) ^ 2, na.rm =  TRUE) / 
  (sum(!is.na(framingham$GLUCOSE)) - 1)
var(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm =  TRUE) 
sqrt(var(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm =  TRUE))
sd_GLU <- sd(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm =  TRUE) 
max_GLU <- max(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = T)
min_GLU <- min(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = TRUE)
range(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR(framingham$GLUCOSE, na.rm = TRUE) 
```

```{r}
summary(framingham$GLUCOSE)
```

### Histogram of the distribution of the glucose

```{r}
ggplot(framingham, aes(x = GLUCOSE)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_GLUC, colour = "red") + geom_vline(xintercept = median_GLU, colour = "blue")
```

## Calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean glucose value

```{r}
SE_GLU <- sd_GLU / sqrt(length(which(!is.na(framingham$GLUCOSE))))
zValue <- qnorm(0.975)                        
lowerCI_mean_GLU <- mean_GLUC - zValue * SE_GLU
upperCI_mean_GLU <- mean_GLUC + zValue * SE_GLU
cbind(mean_GLUC, lowerCI_mean_GLU, upperCI_mean_GLU)                               
n <- length(which(!is.na(framingham$GLUCOSE)))
tQuantile <- qt(p = 0.975, df =  n - 1)
lowerCI_mean_GLU <- mean_GLUC - tQuantile * SE_GLU
upperCI_mean_GLU <- mean_GLUC + tQuantile * SE_GLU
```

## Gaphical comparison in the glucose value between diabetic and non-diabetic

```{r}
framingham <- framingham |> mutate(DIABETES =factor(DIABETES, levels=c(0,1),labels=c("non diabetic","diabetic")))

ggplot(framingham, aes(y=GLUCOSE, x=DIABETES)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

We can see that value of glucose in non diabetic is lower than the one of the diabetic. There is larger distribution in the diabetic population than in the non diabetic population.

## Non-normality

```{r}
head(framingham,5) |>
  kable()
```

### Histogram; whole population

```{r}
framingham <- framingham |> 
  mutate(framingham)
framingham %>%
  ggplot(aes(GLUCOSE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100,
                 color = "black",
                 fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Histogram: separation of non-diabetic and diabetic

```{r}
ggplot(framingham, aes(x = GLUCOSE, fill = DIABETES)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
  facet_wrap(~DIABETES)
  
```

### Quantile-quantile plot

This quantile-quantile plot will allow us to assess the alignement and the theorical ligns.

```{r}
framingham %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = GLUCOSE)) + 
  geom_qq_line(distribution = stats::qnorm) +
  geom_qq(color = "steelblue", distribution = stats::qnorm) + 
  xlab("Theoretical Quantiles") +
  ylab("Sample Quantiles") + 
  facet_wrap(~DIABETES) +
  theme_bw() 

```

We can see that for both population (diabetic and non diabetic), the distribution is not normal. We will run Kolmogorov-Smirnov to see, if the ditribution is normal. (We can see on the graph, that is not the case, but it is in order to use the fonction)

### p-Value calculation

```{r}
ks.test(framingham$GLUCOSE[framingham$DIABETES == "diabetic"], "pnorm")
```

```{r}
ks.test(framingham$GLUCOSE[framingham$DIABETES == "non diabetic"], "pnorm")
```

For both population there is a strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

## Calculation if the mean glucose value differs between diabetics and non-diabetics

```{r}
framingham %>%
  wilcox_test(GLUCOSE ~ DIABETES) %>%
  kable()
```

The difference between the means of the glucose values shows a strong evidence.

## Comparison of the difference betwenn the groups

```{r}
framingham %>% group_by(DIABETES) %>% summarise(mean = mean (GLUCOSE, na.rm = T), median = median(GLUCOSE, na.rm = T), min = min(GLUCOSE, na.rm = T), max = max(GLUCOSE, na.rm = T), sd = sd(GLUCOSE, na.rm = T))
```

We can see that mean and the median of the glucose value is much higher in the population that has diabetes. We can conclude that glucose has an high impact on the diabetes incidence.
